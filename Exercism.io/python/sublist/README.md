# Sublist

Write a function to determine if a list is a sublists of another list.

Write a function that given two lists determines if the first list is
contained within the second list, if the second list is contained within
the first list, if both lists are contained within each other or if none
of these are true.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.
